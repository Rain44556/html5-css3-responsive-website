                <p>We think it's important to have multiple browser engines on the web, and that your applications and
                    websites should function properly regardless of the browser that visitors use. Since we are aware
                    that cross-browser compatibility is important to you as well, all content on this site should make
                    that clear. It's common to find browser support components in many articles; these are powered by
                    data from our friends at MDN, gathered through the Browser Compat Data project.</p>
